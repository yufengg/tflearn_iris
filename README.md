# tflearn_iris
Steps for the iris codelab using tf.learn, with some adjustments and cloud goodness.

Inspired by https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/tflearn

Guide at https://bit.ly/tf-iris-codelab

Notable differences include: 
* step by step code
* Exporting the inference graph
* Training and serving in the cloud

Be sure to install TensorFlow before starting :) You'll want to be on Python 2.7 since that's what gcloud requires.
